# E-commerce & Web Analytics using MySQL

## Objective

This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL (specifically MySQL) for data analysis within an e-commerce and web analytics context. The goal is to extract, transform, and interpret data from simulated business databases (`mavenfuzzyfactory` and `mavenmovies`) to answer key business questions, identify trends, optimize marketing efforts, understand user behavior, and support strategic decision-making.

This repository is intended to showcase analytical thinking and SQL skills relevant for Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Analyst roles.

## Key Analyses & Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases a range of analytical techniques and SQL capabilities, including:

### SQL Proficiency (MySQL)
* **Complex Querying:** Crafting multi-step queries to solve analytical problems.
* **Joins:** Utilizing `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables.
* **Subqueries & Temporary Tables:** Breaking down complex problems and managing intermediate datasets (e.g., in `calculating-bounce-rates.sql`, `product-pathing-analysis.sql`).
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** (Applicable for MySQL 8.0+) For enhanced readability and structuring sequential data transformations.
* **Date/Time Functions:** Extensive use of functions like `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `WEEK()`, `DATE()`, `HOUR()`, `DATE_ADD()` for time-based analysis (e.g., in `analysing-business-patterns-and-seasonality.sql`, `update_created_at_by_2_years.sql`).
* **String Manipulation:** (Implicit in some data handling).
* **Aggregation Functions:** `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` along with `GROUP BY` for summarizing data.
* **Conditional Logic:** Using `CASE` statements for segmentation and custom metric creation (e.g., in `board-meeting-nextweek-Cindy-Sharp-request.sql`).

### Business Focus Areas & Example Scripts

The SQL scripts in this repository address common business intelligence tasks:

1.  **Website Traffic & UTM Analysis:**
    * Analyzing session and order trends by traffic source, campaign, and device.
    * Identifying top traffic drivers and understanding channel performance.
    * *Examples:* `channel-portfolio-analysis.sql`, `analysing-direct-brand-driven-traffic.sql`, `maven-fuzzy-factory-recap.sql` (various sections).

2.  **User Behavior Analysis:**
    * **Conversion Funnels:** Building and analyzing multi-step conversion funnels to identify drop-off points.
        * *Examples:* `build-a-conversion-funnel-015.sql`, `conversion-funnels-and-conversion-path.sql`, `product-coversion-funnels.sql`.
    * **Bounce Rate Calculation:** Identifying the percentage of single-page sessions for landing pages.
        * *Example:* `calculating-bounce-rates.sql`.
    * **Product Pathing Analysis:** Understanding user navigation patterns after viewing product pages.
        * *Example:* `product-pathing-analysis.sql`.
    * **Landing Page Performance:** Tracking trends and performance of specific landing pages.
        * *Example:* `landing-page-trend-analysis-012.sql`.

3.  **A/B Testing Evaluation:**
    * Comparing the performance of different website versions or landing pages.
    * *Examples:* `analysing-landing-page-tests.sql`, `analzying-landing-page-tests-011.sql`.

4.  **Sales & Product Performance Reporting:**
    * Tracking sales, revenue, and margins over time.
    * Analyzing performance of specific products and product launches.
    * *Example:* `anylising-products-sales-and-products-launches.sql`.

5.  **Business Pattern & Seasonality Analysis:**
    * Identifying weekly and daily patterns in user activity and sales.
    * *Example:* `analysing-business-patterns-and-seasonality.sql`.

6.  **Ad-hoc Reporting & Business Requests:**
    * Generating reports to answer specific questions from stakeholders.
    * *Examples:* `board-meeting-nextweek-Cindy-Sharp-request.sql`, `maven-sql-bi-bigainer-mid-course-project.sql`, `maven-sql-bi-bigainer-final-course-project.sql`.

7.  **Data Maintenance:**
    * Scripts for data updates (intended for test environment setup).
    * *Example:* `update_created_at_by_2_years.sql`.

## Datasets Used

The analyses are primarily performed on two simulated datasets:

* **Maven Fuzzy Factory:** A fictional e-commerce business dataset including tables like `website_sessions`, `website_pageviews`, `orders`, `products`, etc.
* **Maven Movies:** A fictional movie rental business dataset (used in `maven-sql-bi-bigainer-mid-course-project.sql` and `maven-sql-bi-bigainer-final-course-project.sql`).

## Tools Used

* **Database:** MySQL
* **SQL Development:** [Specify your SQL editor/IDE, e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, VS Code with SQL extension]
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **(Optional) Visualization:** [Mention if you used any tools like Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau Public, Power BI for visualizing results from these queries]

## Structure of the Repository

This repository contains a collection of `.sql` files, each typically addressing a specific analytical question or task.
*(Consider organizing files into subdirectories like `/traffic_analysis`, `/user_behavior`, `/sales_reporting` as the project grows for better navigation).*

## Highlighted Insights (Examples)

*(Replace these with actual, quantified insights from your analyses if possible. These are illustrative.)*

* **Funnel Optimization Opportunity:** Analysis of the `/lander-1` conversion funnel (see `build-a-conversion-funnel-015.sql`) revealed a significant X% user drop-off between the '/cart' and '/shipping' stages, indicating a potential friction point in the checkout process.
* **A/B Test Success:** The A/B test comparing `/home` and `/lander-1` (analyzed in `analysing-landing-page-tests.sql`) showed that `/lander-1` achieved a Y% lower bounce rate, validating its improved design for user engagement.
* **Mobile Traffic Growth:** Trend analysis in `channel-portfolio-analysis.sql` highlighted a Z% increase in mobile sessions for the 'gsearch' nonbrand campaign over a 3-month period, suggesting a need to optimize the mobile user experience further.

## Future Enhancements

As this project evolves, potential future enhancements include:

* **Deeper Customer Segmentation:** Analyzing customer behavior based on demographics, purchase history, or traffic source.
* **Cohort Analysis:** Tracking user retention and behavior over time.
* **Integration with BI Tools:** Connecting the MySQL database to tools like Tableau Public, Power BI, or Google Looker Studio to create interactive dashboards.
* **Python Integration:** Using Python for automating query execution, performing advanced statistical analysis, and generating visualizations.
* **Advanced SQL Techniques:** Incorporating more window functions and advanced analytical functions for deeper insights.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Prerequisites:** A MySQL server instance.
2.  **Database Setup:** The SQL scripts assume the existence of the `mavenfuzzyfactory` and `mavenmovies` databases and their respective schemas. (If you have schema creation scripts, link them here or explain how to obtain the data).
3.  **Running Queries:** The `.sql` files can be executed using any standard MySQL client or IDE. Ensure you are connected to the correct database.
4.  **Interpreting Results:** Each script is designed to answer specific business questions. Comments within the scripts provide context on the analysis being performed.
